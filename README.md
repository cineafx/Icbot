# Icbot

Very early WIP!  

The icbot is the continuation / revive of the lobbytfbot which I had to put to the side because of no time and later on no interest.  

Now icbot is a way for me to get back into java which I will need at work / university.  



# requirements

Mysql connector for java (import as library)
(I currently use 5.1.45 but every version should work)
